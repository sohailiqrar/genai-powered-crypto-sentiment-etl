## Executive Summary

This project is a production-grade **real-time crypto sentiment intelligence platform** designed using modern data engineering best practices and enhanced with **Generative AI-powered sentiment analysis**.

It ingests live crypto news and price feeds, processes them using a streaming-first Medallion architecture, enriches them with AI-based sentiment scoring, and delivers executive-ready analytics through a BI layer.

The system is architected to reflect **FAANG-level engineering standards** — focusing on scalability, reliability, modularity, fault tolerance, and AI-native data enrichment.

## Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets react instantly to news, social signals, and macroeconomic events. Traditional batch analytics systems fail to:

- Capture real-time market sentiment
- Correlate sentiment shifts with price movements
- Deliver low-latency insights
- Scale reliably during high-volume events

This platform solves that by combining:

- Event-driven architecture
- Distributed stream processing
- Delta Lake storage
- AI-based sentiment enrichment
- Cloud-native data warehousing
- Interactive BI visualization

## Core Technologies

| Category | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Cloud Platform | Azure |
| Messaging | Azure Event Hub |
| Stream Processing | Azure Databricks (PySpark Structured Streaming) |
| Storage Format | Delta Lake |
| Data Warehouse | Snowflake |
| BI Layer | Power BI |
| AI/GenAI Layer | LLM-based Sentiment Classification |
| Architecture Pattern | Medallion Architecture |

---

## GenAI Integration – AI-Native Data Pipeline

A key differentiator of this project is the integration of **Generative AI** for dynamic sentiment classification.

### Why GenAI Instead of Rule-Based NLP?

Traditional approaches rely on:
- Static lexicons
- Pre-trained classification models
- Limited contextual awareness

This project uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to:

- Interpret nuanced crypto news headlines
- Detect contextual sentiment
- Classify sentiment as Positive / Negative / Neutral
- Generate structured sentiment output
- Handle ambiguous financial language

### AI-Enriched Data Example

Raw Input:
"SEC delays ETF approval decision amid regulatory concerns"


GenAI Output:
{  
"symbol": "BTC",  
"prediction": "Negative",  
"confidence": "High",  
"context_summary": "Regulatory uncertainty causing short-term bearish sentiment"  
}


### Engineering Considerations

- API call optimization
- Idempotent sentiment generation
- Structured JSON schema enforcement
- Latency-aware AI invocation
- Retry & fallback mechanism
- AI cost-conscious batching

This reflects alignment with modern **AI-first data platforms**.
